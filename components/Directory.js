        <p>
          We are a software company that gives intelligent sight to embedded and
          loT devices. We enable these devices to autonomously make smart
          decisions in real time, untethered from the cloud. Our developer
          platform fast-tracks the creation and deployment of computer vision
          apps on edge devices. By working with many AI model framework
          technologies and endpoint environments, alwaysAI significantly
          accelerates the time it takes to get a computer vision app up and
          running. Our platform comes pre-loaded with a growing model catalog,
          starter apps, and core computer vision APIs (including object
          detection, tracking and counting; image classification, pose
          estimation & semantic segmentation) enabling the development of a wide
          range of computer vision applications that work with most endpoints.
